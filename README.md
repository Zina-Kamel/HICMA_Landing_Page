### Temporary notes

For now, hicma.html is the main route to start with, so start by running it please.

Note:
Currently working on smaller media queries.

I'm done with the navigation bar for 992 <= width < 1200. It will be the same for smaller media queries with some adjustments. Also done with contact us for 992 <= width < 1200. Concerning the navigation bar, I wrote the 3 most important pages for it to be user-friendly. If you want to add other pages instead lmk. I couldn't put them all since they would overflow if I keep space among them, and they would be next to each other if I remove the space.

To see the results, please open your browser in a way: 992 <= width < 1200 ==> open contactUs.html page, and see the navbar.
